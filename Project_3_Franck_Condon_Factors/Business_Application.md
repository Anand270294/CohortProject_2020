# Quantum Cohort Project Business Application

For each weekly project, your team is asked to complete the below business application exercise.
To complement the technical tasks, please consdier the four questions below.
You are free to format your response to these four questions as you wish (with the final question done as a short recorded video), and to include
the content (or links to the content) on your forked repository.

A brief example for each question is included for the 
[Traveling Salesman Problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise
The focus of this project is to study spectroscopy from a quantum viewpoint. The Frank Codon Factor explains the intensity of vibronic transitions. Vibronic transitions are the changes in the electronic and vibrational energy of molecules when interacting with electromagnetic radiation. Spectroscopy is the study of matter and its interaction with electromagnetic radiation. Through spectroscopy and Frank Codon Factors, we can study and understand the properties of molecules. 

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

#### Astronomical Studies:
  >Astronomers leverage astronomical spectroscopy in the study of chemical compositions belonging to distant stars. The absorption lines of the sun and the emission spectra of different gases help identify the chemical constituents of the stars.
  
#### Food and Beverage:
  >The food industry currently leverages spectroscopy in the analyses required to improve the quality control of foods and beverages. Vendors can determine the falsification, adulterations, identification of origin, the origin and variety of wine. 
  
#### Forensic Applications
  >Forensic Scientists will use spectroscopy for :
  
>Toxicology Analysis:
	Forensic analysts can identify the presence of toxic substances and their concentrations found in tissue samples and bodily fluids. Investigators can gain valuable information about the time and dosage of any poison. 
  
>Trace Evidence:
	Investigators can analyze trace elements such as fibers, glass fragments, or paint flakes. Spectroscopy can determine the exact combination of dyes used in carpet fibers and constituent components of any material analyzed. 
  
>Arson Investigations:
	investigators can analyze any residue found at a crime scene and generate accurate reports on the molecular makeup of the substance.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved

Examples: 
- Federal Express
- Canada Post

## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
