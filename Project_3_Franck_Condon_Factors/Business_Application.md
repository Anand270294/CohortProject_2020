![CDL 2020 Cohort Project](../figures/CDL_logo.jpg)

**TODO** let's give a name to the Business Application, note to remove the text about each " ... each weekly project ..." and at the end about the "Example: By travelling to all destinations ..." we will have to add references to Liv-ex and the other sources for statistical data...

## Step 1: Explain the technical problem you solved in this exercise
The focus of this project is to study spectroscopy from a quantum viewpoint. The Frank Condon Factor explains the intensity of vibronic transitions. Vibronic transitions are the changes in the electronic and vibrational energy of molecules when interacting with electromagnetic radiation. Spectroscopy is the study of matter and its interaction with electromagnetic radiation. Through spectroscopy and Frank Condon Factors, we can study and understand the properties of molecules. A comparison of the spectroscopic data from a sample can tell us about its temperature and chemical composition. The spectroscopic data is a fingerprint! It can be compared to other well-known sample templates to pin-down the origin and location of the sample.

## Step 2: Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

#### Astronomical Studies:
  >Astronomers leverage astronomical spectroscopy in the study of chemical compositions belonging to distant stars. The absorption lines of the sun and the emission spectra of different gases help identify the chemical constituents of the stars.
  
#### Food and Beverage:
  >The food industry currently leverages spectroscopy in the analyses required to improve the quality control of foods and beverages. Vendors can determine the falsification, adulterations, identification of origin, the origin and variety of food, beverages, and especially wine. 
  
#### Forensic Applications
  >Forensic Scientists will use spectroscopy for :
  
>Toxicology Analysis:
	Forensic analysts can identify the presence of toxic substances and their concentrations found in tissue samples and bodily fluids. Investigators can gain valuable information about the time and dosage of any poison. 
  
>Trace Evidence:
	Investigators can analyze trace elements such as fibers, glass fragments, or paint flakes. Spectroscopy can determine the exact combination of dyes used in carpet fibers and constituent components of any material analyzed. 
  
>Arson Investigations:
	investigators can analyze any residue found at a crime scene and generate accurate reports on the molecular makeup of the substance.

## Step 3: Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved
The global wine market in 2018 had a valuation of 354.7 billion U.S dollars. The projected market growth is 21% by 2023 to a value of 429 billion U.S dollars.  However, the market is currently facing a wave of counterfeit products. Counter fitters are flooding the market with sub-par products, which not only takes profit away from the vineyards but also poses a threat to brand reputability. Estimates place at least 20% of the world wine supply as fake. Liv-ex a worldwide secondary market for wine with a believed approximate value of $5 billion. If as much as 20% of their wine is fake, then the counterfeit trade for their product is currently worth $1 billion. With such large sums of money lost to fraud, the wine industry is in desperate need of a solution that can verify the authenticity of their products.

## Impact of GPL, Apache2.0 on intellectual property rights of the coder:
#### Business Application:

The codes in Project 3 (FCF_calc) use General Public License and Apache 2.0 licenses.  Discuss the similarities and differences of these with respect to intellectual property rights of the coder.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of codes licensed for the public domain and those that are licensed for private use?

#### Pros and Cons of Public Domain code and Private code:
###### Note: The following is an opinion created as part of a training exercise, may not be correct and certainly does not count as a legal opinion on the matter of software Licensing. Feel free to make it an item of discussion.

#### IP and your Startup:
You have been working and hacking away at code to solve interesting problems. You may have created some of your own original code and/or also may have leveraged public domain code. Eureka! your work is now your secret sauce for your new product for your startup and you intend on protecting your IP. 

Oh, but wait ... can you actually do that? After all you have only used one GPL licensed piece of code of about 1000 lines, slightly modified. Surely your secret sauce that accounts for 100,000 lines of code, makes that modified 1000 lines insignificant, right?

Well, no, you cannot. 

If you use GPL license code in your product, your code is also under GPL. You will not be able keep your code secret. 

We do not explore the legal ramifications of various combinations here (do talk to a lawyer for your specific cases), but it is important to incorporate an IP strategy, relating to new or existing work, into your startup.

#### Licenses:
There are various types of licenses but most license applicable to open source software are designed to foster collaboration between creators with de-risking relative liability and royalty payments that could impair technological advancement. They only ask, with variations, that original creators be credited and that the new work be subject of similar constraints. Often that means one may not be able to keep their code secret. 

#### What is "Copyleft"?
Copyleft is the practice of granting the right to freely distribute and modify intellectual property with the requirement that the same rights be preserved in derivative works created from that property. 

Copyleft licenses include the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**. 

#### What are "Permissive" licenses?:
Permissive software licenses are "non-copyleft" licenses. Permissive licenses include **GNU All-permissive License, MIT License, BSD licenses, Apple Public Source License and Apache license**

#### GNU Public License (GPL):
GPL in software essentially means this: **If you modify a version of a GPL license code, your work must be under GPL also**
So in our introduction example, if your software uses any GPL code, or depends on using (not even modifying) a third-party library that is under GPL, your entire software product must be released under GPL. 

This has the following implications (among others) for your software: 
	
	First, you need to have the GPL license text with your code, indicating it is subject to GPL
    	Your source code must be made available to the public.
    	Therefore, you cannot declare your code as Intellectual Property to avoid disclosing the source


## Step 4: Prepare a 90 second video explaining the value proposition of your innovation to this potential customer in non-technical language

Example: By travelling to all destinations via the shortest route, a courier can generate the same revenue that it would have generated following any other route, but will minimize travel costs (e.g., fuel costs). By minimizing travel costs, the courier will be more profitable than it would have been had it travelled through any other route.
